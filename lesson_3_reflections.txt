When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
? when I working on different computer
? when work is very important that need backup
? when I want to share with other

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
? To prevent the addition of unauthorized commit

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
? Fork: pull other repository from GitHub to GitHub
? Clones: copy from one site to the other site on the same local; copy 
from others GitHub to my local
? Branches: make another separate commit from the master route

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?
? So that you can we will not loss the important information
? To confirm what we had done

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?
? Without Git, I would make many copy everytime I make a significant 
change, and this is a harder part. The easier part, well, I dont have to
remember any code
? Without GitHub, I think I will change the format if I want to share 
my code with others, and the harder part I will spend a lot of time do
merge them manually. I guess the easier part is the same, I dont have to
remember all this code
